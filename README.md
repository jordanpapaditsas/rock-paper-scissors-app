# Rock-Paper-Scissors App

## Description  
The Rock, Paper, and Scissors game is an enjoyable and straightforward game where both players choose between:  
***rock***, ***paper***, or ***scissors***. It results in only two possible outcomes: 
a ***tie***, or a ***win*** for one player and a ***loss*** for the other player.  

## Rules  
In this game, the player must select one option from the following: **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.   
The computer will generate a **random** option, and the player or computer will earn one **point** for each round won.
